# Missing Values

A discussion on missing values and what tools researchers apply to deal with this issue. The paper explores the difference between:

  * Missing completely at random (MCAR)
  * Missing at random (MAR)
  * Missing not at random (MNAR)
  
We further discuss the potential solutions including:

* Listwise deletion
* Pairwise deletion
* Single imputation
* Maximum likelihood
* Multiple imputation
